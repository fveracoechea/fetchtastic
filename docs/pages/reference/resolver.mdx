# FetchResolver

The `FetchResolver` class is a generic class that represents a resolver for making HTTP requests with a specific HTTP method. It is used in conjunction with the `Fetchtastic` class to perform various HTTP operations such as sending requests, handling responses, and parsing response data.

**Properties:**

-   `method`: The HTTP method associated with the resolver request to be resolved (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.).

## Constructor

```typescript
constructor(config: Fetchtastic, method: Method) { /** */ }
```

Creates a new instance of the `FetchResolver` class.

-   `config`: The `Fetchtastic` instance representing the request configuration.
-   `method`: The HTTP method associated with the resolver.

## Methods

### `config`

```typescript
config(updateFn: (config: Fetchtastic) => void): FetchResolver<Method>
```

Updates the configuration of the associated `Fetchtastic` instance.

-   `updateFn`: A function that takes the current `Fetchtastic` instance as a parameter and modifies it.

Returns the `FetchResolver` instance.

### `resolve`

```typescript
resolve(): Promise<Response>
```

Sends the HTTP request and resolves with the `Response` object representing the response.

Returns a promise that resolves with the `Response` object if the request is successful.

### `json`

```typescript
json<T = unknown>(assertData?: DataAssertionFn<T>): Promise<T>
```

Parses the response data as JSON and resolves with the parsed data.

-   `assertData` (optional): An assertion function to validate the parsed JSON data. If provided, the parsed data is passed to this function for validation.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed JSON data.

### `arrayBuffer`

```typescript
arrayBuffer(): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
```

Parses the response data as an `ArrayBuffer` and resolves with the parsed data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed `ArrayBuffer` data.

### `blob`

```typescript
blob(): Promise<Blob>
```

Parses the response data as a `Blob` and resolves with the parsed data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed `Blob` data.

### `formData`

```typescript
formData(): Promise<FormData>
```

Parses the response data as a `FormData` object and resolves with the parsed data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed `FormData` object.

### `text`

```typescript
text(): Promise<string>
```

Parses the response data as plain text and resolves with the parsed data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed text data.
