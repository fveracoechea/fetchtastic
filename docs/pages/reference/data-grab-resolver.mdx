# DataGrabResolver Class

The `DataGrabResolver` class is a generic class that represents a resolver for making HTTP requests with a specific HTTP method. It is used in conjunction with the `DataGrab` class to perform various HTTP operations such as sending requests, handling responses, and parsing response data.

## Generic Type

-   `Method`: Represents the HTTP method of the request (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.).

## Properties

-   `method: HttpMethod`: The HTTP method associated with the resolver.

## Constructor

### `constructor(config: DataGrab, method: Method)`

Creates a new instance of the `DataGrabResolver` class.

-   `config: DataGrab`: The `DataGrab` instance representing the request configuration.
-   `method: Method`: The HTTP method associated with the resolver.

## Methods

### `setConfig(updateFn: (config: DataGrab) => void): DataGrabResolver<Method>`

Updates the configuration of the associated `DataGrab` instance.

-   `updateFn: (config: DataGrab) => void`: A function that takes the current `DataGrab` instance as a parameter and modifies it.

Returns the `DataGrabResolver` instance.

### `resolve(): Promise<Response>`

Sends the HTTP request and resolves with the `Response` object representing the response.

Returns a promise that resolves with the `Response` object if the request is successful.

### `json<T = unknown>(assertData?: DataAssertionFn<T>): Promise<T>`

Parses the response data as JSON and resolves with the parsed data.

-   `assertData: DataAssertionFn<T>` (optional): An assertion function to validate the parsed JSON data. If provided, the parsed data is passed to this function for validation.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed JSON data.

### `arrayBuffer(): Promise<ArrayBuffer>`

Parses the response data as an `ArrayBuffer` and resolves with the parsed data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed `ArrayBuffer` data.

### `blob(): Promise<Blob>`

Parses the response data as a `Blob` and resolves with the parsed data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed `Blob` data.

### `formData(): Promise<FormData>`

Parses the response data as a `FormData` object and resolves with the parsed data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed `FormData` object.

### `text(): Promise<string>`

Parses the response data as plain text and resolves with the parsed data.

Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed text data.
