This section covers the essential building blocks of Fetchtastic, including
Request Configuration, Http Methods, Response Methods, and Error Catchers.

You'll learn how to configure your network requests to ensure they are
predictable and type-safe, explore the various methods available for handling
responses, and understand how to effectively catch and manage errors.

## Request configuration

in **Fetchtastic**, it refers to the set of options and methods available to
customize a network request to your specific needs. By using these configuration
options, you can control various aspects of how a request is made, ensuring that
it meets the requirements of your application while maintaining predictability
and type safety.

Here’s a breakdown of what you can configure:

#### Headers

Specify custom headers to be included with your request, such as authorization
tokens, content types, or any other metadata necessary for the server to process
the request correctly.

- [setHeaders](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#setheaders)
- [appendHeader](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#appendheader)
- [deleteHeader](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#deleteheader)

#### AbortController

Integrate an
[AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController)
to manage the cancellation of requests. This is particularly useful for aborting
ongoing requests when they are no longer needed, preventing unnecessary resource
usage.

- [controller](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#controller)

#### URL and Search Parameters

Define the specific path of the URL to which the request will be sent. This
allows you to target different endpoints within the same domain.

As well add query parameters to the URL to pass additional data or filter
results. These parameters can be easily appended to the URL, enabling you to
modify the request without altering the main URL path.

- [url](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#url-1)
- [setSearchParams](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#setsearchparams)
- [appendSearchParam](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#appendsearchparam)
- [deleteSearchParam](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#deletesearchparam)

:::info

Request's url can also be extended using Http method functions.

:::

#### Request Body

For methods like POST, PUT, or PATCH, configure the request body to include the
data you want to send to the server. Fetchtastic ensures that the body is
properly JSON stringified when content-type `application/json` has been
specified in the headers.

- [setBody](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#setbody)

:::info

Request's body can also be set on some Http method functions.

:::

#### Other Options

Beyond these, you can configure additional options such as credentials, referrer
policy, mode (e.g., cors, same-origin), and more, to fine-tune the behavior of
your request to suit specific scenarios.

- [setOptions](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#setoptions)

## HTTP methods

These functions when called, set a specific HTTP method to the request
configuration. Likewise, you can pass optional url and body arguments to these
methods if needed.

- [get](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#get)
- [post](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#post)
- [put](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#put)
- [delete](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#delete)
- [options](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#options)
- [patch](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#patch)
- [head](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#head)

## Error Catchers

They play a crucial role in managing and handling responses that aren't
successful (those that return HTTP error codes like 404 or 500).

Unlike the standard fetch API, which requires manual checking of response
statuses, Fetchtastic automatically throws an error for any
[non-OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/ok) responses
unless you've provided an error catcher to handle it.

- [ onError ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#onerror)
- [ badRequest ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#badrequest)
- [ unauthorized ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#unauthorized)
- [ forbidden ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#forbidden)
- [ notFound ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#notfound)
- [ timeout ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#timeout)
- [ serverError ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#servererror)

### Key Points

- Error catchers are registered once and shared across instances.
- The original request is passed along with the error, allowing for the creation
  of reusable error handling functions.
- Error catchers can be overwritten for specific instances as needed.
- Catchers are optional, but if none are provided an error will still be thrown
  for http error codes and it will be up to you to catch it.

Here’s how Error Catchers work:

#### Automatic Error Handling

By default, Fetchtastic throws an
[ResponseError](/docs/api/classes/ResponseError) when it encounters an HTTP
response with a status code that isn’t in the 200–299 range. This ensures that
you don’t accidentally overlook failed requests, making error handling a more
explicit and intentional part of your code.

#### Custom Error Catchers

If you want more control over how errors are handled, you can provide a custom
error catcher. This is a function that allows you to intercept these errors in a
more declarative approach and decide what to do with them. For example, you
might want to display a user-friendly message, log the error for further
analysis, or retry the request under certain conditions.

#### Fallback Handling:

Error catchers can also act as a safety net, ensuring that unexpected errors
don’t break your application. By catching and managing these errors, you can
maintain a smooth user experience even when things go wrong.

## Response methods

These functions when called, execute the HTTP request and return a promise with
its response.

The primary objectives of these functions involve initiating the HTTP request
with the existing configuration, with a focus on managing responses, and parsing
the resulting data.

- [ resolve ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#resolve)
- [ json ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#json)
- [ arrayBuffer ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#arraybuffer)
- [ blob ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#blob)
- [ formData ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#formdata)
- [ text ](/docs/api/classes/Fetchtastic#text)

## Fluent Interface Design

**Fetchtastic** combines its features through a fluent interface API design,
enabling you to chain methods together in a clear and concise manner. This
design allows you to configure your requests step-by-step, with each method call
returning the modified instance, making it easy to build and customize requests
without needing separate setup steps.

```typescript
const posts = await fetchtastic('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com')
  .get('/posts')
  .setSearchParams({ page: 1, first: 12 })
  .appendHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json')
  .notFound(() => Response.json({ message: 'Record not found' }))
  .json();
```
